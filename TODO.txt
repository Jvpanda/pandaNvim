Implement new functions to simplify code:
• |vim.fs.rm()| can delete files and directories.
• |vim.fs.abspath()| converts paths to absolute paths.
• |vim.fs.relpath()| gets relative path compared to base path.
• |vim.fs.dir()| and |vim.fs.find()| can now follow symbolic links,
  the behavior can be turn on using the new `follow` option.
• |vim.fs.root()| can define "equal priority" via nested lists.
